<strong>The Founder of Nepal and the History of Nepal</strong> <p>
    Nepal was founded on 25th of September in 1768, Prithvi Narayan Shah was crowned King as he was the founder of Nepal.<br>
    Before Nepal was named Nepal it was called Gorkha Kingdom which was ruled by Prithvi Narayan Shah from 1768 to 1775. Prithvi Narayan Shah was called the Father of Nepal as he started unification of Nepal.<br>
    Nepal has never been conquered because Nepal had strong rulers that protected Nepal very well.<br>
    The Rana (King) of Nepal made an alliance with the British Empire so that is why Nepal was never in the British Empire as the other parts of South Asia were conquered by the British Empire.<br>
    Nepal served as a buffer state between imperial China and British India. <br>
    Many many years later on the 1st of June  2001 the royal family of Nepal was massacred, 10 people died including the killer who allegedly was the Crown Prince Dipendra Bir Bikram Shah and 5 were injured but there are still people from the royal family who are still alive but on the 28th of May 2008 was when Nepal became a democracy country making 240 years of monarchy to an end but a lot of people miss the royal family of Nepal that is why a wave of people want the royal family again so they want the former King of Nepal Raja(king) Gyanendra and his family to rule again.<br>
    The royal place is a museum now which people pay money which is Nepali Rupees to see inside.<br>
